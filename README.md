# Class Activity 13A

This class activity is intended to demonstrate:

- How to work with geographic data from [Open Street Maps (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
- The Python packages
  - [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for accessing OSM data.
  - [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) for representing and manipulating graphs.
  - [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html) for representing geospatial data in Pandas dataframes.

You can use this repository in one of two ways:

- You can clone it directly using the standard Git procedure.  In that case you **will not** be able to push your edits back up to this repository (you only have read access to this repository).
- You can copy this repository as a template in to your own GitHub account by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).  Using your own copy you can then push and pull as much as you like.  (We recommend that you make your own copy private so that other students won't confuse your repository with this one.)
